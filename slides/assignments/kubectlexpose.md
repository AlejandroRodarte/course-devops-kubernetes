# Assignment: first deployment

- Create a deployment with a container using image `tomcat`.

- Find the IP address of that Tomcat server.

- Ping it!

  (Use the `shpod` environment if necessary.)

- What happens if we delete the pod that holds Tomcat?

---

## Assignment: first service

- How can we give our Tomcat server a stable address?

  (An address that doesn't change when something bad happens to the container.)

- Create such an address.

- Check that you can connect to Tomcat with that address.

  (Use the `shpod` environment if necessary.)

- If we delete again the pod that holds Tomcat, does the address still work?
